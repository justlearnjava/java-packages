# java-packages

Welcome to Just Learn Java, where you go to learn the Java(TM) language. 
This repository contains the code that accompanies the [Java Packages video](https://youtu.be/gBDKmAIgdHc), 
which is part of the Just Learn the Java(TM) Language Video Tutorial Series, 
available on YouTube from 
[the Just Learn Java YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC6YU5vihI_jn2H-iRW1Xc3g/).

The structure of the repository is as follows:

```
java-packages
├── LICENSE
├── README.md
├── pom.xml
├── solution
│   └── com
│       └── example
│           └── packages

```

This is a standard Maven project. Maven uses the `pom.xml` file to manage building,
testing, and packaging the project, as well as managing the project's dependencies. 

The code is licensed under the Apache 2.0 open source license (see `LICENSE`, also `copyright.txt`).

You're looking at `README.md` right now.

Files under `src` are where you write your code to follow along with the video.
There are TODO comments in the code if you want to go it alone, but you should
really check out the [Java Packages Video](https://youtu.be/gBDKmAIgdHc) on [the Just Learn Java YouTube
channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC6YU5vihI_jn2H-iRW1Xc3g/). 

If you get stuck, check out the `solution` directory.

***If you need to report an issue with the code, please log an issue to this repository!***

Have fun!
